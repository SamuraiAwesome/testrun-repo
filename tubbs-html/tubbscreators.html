        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>The Tubbs Force was created by two 10-year-old kids: Sam and Cole. 
        They came up with the idea based on an imaginary cat that
        rode to swim lessons with them on the roof of their car. Later on a third member
        was added to the team: Riley,an accomplished coder who was given access to the website in its creation stage.
        More members were added: Noah, an accomplished artist, Remy, and Luke, who has now quit the team. The team is now recruiting more members.</p>
