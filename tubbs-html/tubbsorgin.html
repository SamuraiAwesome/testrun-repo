      <h2>Tubbs's Birth</h2> 
      <p>Tubbs was born fat. He was born under the care of Mubbs, Tubb's mom,
      and Hubbs, Tubbs's uncle. He started to roll at two months,
       and started to walk at eleven months. His walking was delayed by
       his fatness.</p>

       <p>As a baby, Tubbs learned that when he ate, his fatness increased. He also discovered that cheezeboggers were nutritious
       to cats like him. </p>
